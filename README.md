## SQL Queries
The following MySQL queries were developed to extract and manipulate data for the Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard, ensuring accuracy and addressing key business challenges:

1. **Total Sales and Orders for Each Month**:
   ```sql
   With Sales AS (
     SELECT
       DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
       ROUND(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price)) AS total_sales,
       COUNT(transaction_id) AS total_orders,
       SUM(transaction_qty) AS total_qty_sold
     FROM coffee_sales
     GROUP BY month
   )
   SELECT
     month,
     CONCAT(ROUND(total_sales/1000), 'K') AS total_sales,
     CONCAT(ROUND(total_orders/1000), 'K') AS total_orders,
     CONCAT(ROUND((total_sales - LAG(total_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / LAG(total_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100), '%') AS sales_diff_pct
   FROM Sales;
   ```
   
2. **Sales Trends by Days**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     CASE
       WHEN DAYOFWEEK(transaction_date) = 2 THEN 'Monday'
       WHEN DAYOFWEEK(transaction_date) = 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
       WHEN DAYOFWEEK(transaction_date) = 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
       WHEN DAYOFWEEK(transaction_date) = 5 THEN 'Thursday'
       WHEN DAYOFWEEK(transaction_date) = 6 THEN 'Friday'
       WHEN DAYOFWEEK(transaction_date) = 7 THEN 'Saturday'
       ELSE 'Sunday'
     END AS day_of_weeks,
     CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price)/1000), 'K') AS total_sales
   FROM coffee_sales
   WHERE DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') = '2023-06'
   GROUP BY day_of_weeks
   ORDER BY SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) DESC;
   ```

3. **Sales Trends by Hours**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     HOUR(transaction_time) AS hour_of_day,
     CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price)/1000), 'K') AS total_sales
   FROM coffee_sales
   WHERE DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') = '2023-06'
   GROUP BY hour_of_day
   ORDER BY hour_of_day;
   ```

4. **Store Performance**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     store_location,
     CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price)/1000), 'K') AS total_sales
   FROM coffee_sales
   WHERE DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') = '2023-06'
   GROUP BY store_location
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
   ```

5. **Best-Selling Products Category**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     product_category,
     CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price)/1000),'K') AS total_sales
   FROM coffee_sales
   WHERE DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') = '2023-06'
   GROUP BY product_category
   ORDER BY SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) DESC;
   ```
   
6. **Best-Selling Products Type**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     product_type,
     CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price)/1000), 'K') AS total_sales
   FROM coffee_sales
   WHERE DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') = '2023-06'
   GROUP BY product_type
   ORDER BY SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
   
## Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates the following skills:
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive visualizations to represent complex data.
